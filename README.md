# Wifi-Scan-Data

This project is part of a much larger project (Collaborative project) of the Master DID (Développement et Ingénierie des données) at the University of Toulon aiming at developing an android application allowing indoor localization through the Wifi networks thanks to machine learning.

This is an android application allowing to scan Wifi networks nearby and export the networks' data into text files in order to train the machine learning model (Random Forest). It also allows localizing the user by scanning the wifi network of the room and sending the information in JSON Format throughout a Client/Server allowing to receive back a prediction regarding room in which the user is.
