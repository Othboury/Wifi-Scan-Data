# Wifi-Scan-Data

This project is part of a much larger project (Collaborative project) of the Master DID (Développement et Ingénierie des données) in the univeristy of Toulon
aiming at developing an android application allowing indoor localization through the Wifi networks thanks to machine learning.

This is a first android application allowing to scan Wifi networks nearby and export the networks' data into txt files in order to train the machine
learning model (Random Forest). It also allows to localize the user by scanning the the wifi network of the room and sending the information
in Json Format throughtout a Client/Server proccess allowing to receive back a prediction of the room in which the user is.
